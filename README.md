# Teach the RAM model to count

We are trying to build a artificial agent that learns to count the number of objects in a scene. Previous, we built a simple agent bsaed on Q learning. Here, we are using a more sophisticated architecture: the recurrent model of attention [1], or RAM. 

Our actual implementation of the RAM, and replication of [1] is [here](https://github.com/QihongL/RAM). In this repo, I am using this RAM model to do some counting related tasks.
